              Moba stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. The game is, like many sports and game, based on war. There are two teams, of 5 players, each defending their own, and looking to destroy the other’s nexus. Defending the Nexus are 9 outer turrets, 2 Nexus turrets, and 3 inhibitors, which inhibit the production of enemy “minions”.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is each teams goal to destroy enemy towers, and inhibityors, in order to gain access to, and destroy the enemy nexus. In order to do this, the teams must strategize, and work towards getting enemy towers, and team mates out of the way.

              Personally, my interest in MOBA, and especially League comes from Warcraft, where moba games were designed from.  I started playing Warcraft 2 at around age 11, and eventually got pretty good at it. By the time Warcraft 3, and the sub-game DOTA (Defense of the Ancients) had become popular, I was well versed in the game, and how to play it.
            </p>
            <p>
              After years of playing RTS (real time strategy) games. I decided to find one that I could really stick my guns to, and League was where I settled, with such a massively growing worldwide presence, and growth rate, it was hard to stay away.

            The in game scoreboard shows several mechanics related to gameplay and success. Next to each player’s name there is a few statistics. You have items,  Kills/Deaths/Assists, gold earned, and CS (creep score).
          </p>
          <p>
            The way you itemize your champion strongly influences your performance (along with skill and positioning). Creep score depicts how many enemy minions the player has last hitted, gaining the gold rewarded for killing te unit.
